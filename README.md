1.  **Time-Shift Atmosphere** 🕰️
    - The site's vibe changes in real-time based on your local time.
    - **Day (6:00-16:00)**: Bright sunlight and floating dust motes.
    - **Evening (16:00-19:00)**: Nostalgic sunset orange.
    - **Night (19:00-6:00)**: Deep night, where **fireflies** dance and your cursor becomes a **lantern**.

2.  **Soot Sprites** ⚫
    - Small black spirits (Soot Sprites) scurry away when you move your mouse.

3.  **Konpeito Magic** 🍬
    - Click anywhere to release a burst of colorful star candies (Konpeito).

4.  **Scroll Cat** 🐈
    - A cat walks along the top edge of the screen to indicate your scroll progress.

5.  **Windy Leaves** 🍃
    - Occasionally, watercolor leaves dance across the screen carried by the wind.

6.  **Jelly Physics** 🍮
    - Buttons and images react with a "jelly-like" bounce when clicked or hovered.
